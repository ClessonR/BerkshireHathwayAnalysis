I've always been an **admirer** of Warren Buffet and his Company (Berkshire Hathway). In Brazil, there's a huge concern for "safe" and fixed returns, and funds aren't really a thing for the ordinary people. So, I'll create simples and specific visualizations to show how much better investments funds, when managed by great investors, are when compared to the S&P 500, one of the most famous indexes in the world.
